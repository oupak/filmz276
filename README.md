## What is the name of your web application?
Filmz
 
## Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?
 
### How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?
The problem we are trying to solve is the issue of not being able to find reliable “audience based” information about movies one may be wanting to watch. There are plenty of movie rating websites out there such as IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes but they all take movie critic reviews more seriously and the average movie review gets pushed to the side. With our website we are hoping to make our review system strictly user based.
### How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?
This will make life much better because in today's day and age, most movies reviews are tainted by biased movie critics that are trying to push the narrative of the company that is employing them. With our website we put the average movie watcher first and try to bring the most unbiased response as possible. 
### Who is the target audience? Who will use your app or play your game?
The target audience is anyone who enjoys watching movies, which is the larger majority. Anyone looking for unbiased reviews on a movie, or wants to talk about a movie, or leave comments about a movie can use this app to their benefit. This app can be used by almost anyone, however will most commonly be used by movie enthusiasts.
 
## What is the scope of your project?
 
### Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.
Our project will have a few individual features. The main page will display a comment/blog section for users to discuss different movies and ratings, and a “what’s hot” section that shows popular movies with the best ratings. It will also have a search bar at the top that allows you to search for a specific movie that you had in mind; when clicking on a movie, it will display the rating of the movie and a short summary. We will be using a IMDb based API to include a list of all the movies into our website and make them all accessible via the search bar.
 
### What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do?  These are the ‘stories’ of your project.
As a user, you can use this site to help decide if you wanted to watch a new movie that just came out, or discuss your opinions about certain movies with other users on the site. You could also read a quick summary about a movie you haven’t heard much about alongside the reviews and decide if it would be something you would be interested in. As a user you can also leave your own reviews on movies you have watched, and comments as to why you did or did not enjoy them. The goal of this website is to have community reviews, rather than reviews left by critics.
 
### Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?
This project has enough features to keep us busy throughout the semester and will be a good amount to split up between the five group members.
